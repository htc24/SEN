Social-Ecological Narratives - SESYNC Grad Pursuits Project

Leveraging Social-Ecological Narratives for Sustainability Insights:
How Do Environmental Conditions and Perceptions Interact Along Maine’s Storied Coast?

This Graduate Pursuit aims to explore the role of narratives within social-ecological system dynamics. We define these social-ecological narratives as the stories through which communities understand their interactions and co-dependencies with an ecological system. Social-ecological systems (SES) research recognizes the importance of understanding relationships within and between systems 



This project aims to:

-Define and explore the concept of a “social-ecological narrative” and its role within a social-ecological system

-Refine methods for data integration and analysis across natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities--in particular the processing of under-utilized data from literary sources

-Apply these approaches to the case-study of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in coastal Maine
