## Social-Ecological Narratives Graduate Pursuit  

#### Leveraging Social-Ecological Narratives for Sustainability Insights: How Do Environmental Conditions and Perceptions Interact Along Maineâ€™s Storied Coast?

This Graduate Pursuit aims to explore the role of narratives within social-ecological system dynamics. We define these **social-ecological narratives** as *the stories through which communities understand their interactions and co-dependencies with an ecological system*. Our methods rely on data integration and analysis across natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities--in particular the processing of under-utilized data from literary, media, and other textual sources.


Our project proposes to apply this approach to the case-study of oysters (*Crassostrea virginica*) in coastal Maine. Here we present our initial approach to prepare a variety of text-based data sources for analysis.


### Overview of Preparations for Text Analysis  


* Convert various documents to standardized .txt files using template header (thanks Melissa!)

```
        START HEADER
        SOURCE: 
        TITLE: 
        AUTHOR: 
        DATE:
        LOCATION:
        TYPE:  
        END HEADER

        This is the body, or primary text of the article.
```
  
* Collect .txt files into a corpus of documents  

* In RStudio, create a [corpus object](https://www.tidytextmining.com/dtm.html#tidying-corpus-objects-with-metadata) by extracting header and body text from each document in corpus to create a single table with header items and body as columns

```

[Insert code from Janardan here :)]

```

* document term matrix https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidying_casting.html

* figure 6.1

* topic modeling

* sentiment analysis

* word frequency over time

* geolocation (mapping of stories...)


# Notes and Ideas for Text Analysis

### Potentially Useful R Packages

* [tidytext](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/index.html)

  + Text mining for word processing and sentiment analysis using 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', and other tidy tools.








```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
